# BootstrapBasedPortfolio
Portfolio Web Page built on Bootstrap 4 code

## Project Summary
I have created a portfolio web page to introduce myself to anyone who may be interested in my coding experience and project portfolio. In this web page I provide a brief introduction to myself, links to key projects I have worked on and my contact and GitHub details. I can then provide a link to this webpage to parties such as potential employers or colleagues to provide an overview my work. The web page itself is an advertisement for my coding and so has tto be visual appealing, well laid out and adaptible to different viewports.

To create this web page I used HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling. I created a navigation bar linking to different sections of the page, a dividing banner for the site aesthetics, an 'about me' section with my skills and a brief introduction, a 'work' section with links to projects (currently 'dead' links) of which one project stands out with a larger image and button, and a 'Contact Me' section with my contact details and link to my GitHub repository. I used bootstrap 4 for this web page development, as a way to bring well designed ready built elements into the page. I used the bootstrap navbar, jumbotron, containers, cards and buttons in the building of the page. 

I have also used semantic HTML, arranged the code semantically and included an 'alt' description on my headshot image- this will make the website easier to read when using a screeen reader, and makes the code easier to follow. I have also added comments to clearly explain the code, to make it easy to understand for myself when I come back to it or for anyone else looking at the code.
